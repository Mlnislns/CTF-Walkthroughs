\# O8: Performing an Exfil of a Filesystem

\#\# Problem Description  
You have a solid foothold in The Lucky Lion's environment \- now it's time to start poking around. Looking through more of the emails from the account you compromised, you see something interesting: a backup of a server was recently uploaded to a secure fileshare. You wager there could be some valuable information to sell if you can get those files, but the backup is password protected.

To get you started, we've provided you with the host & port where we've noticed a password vault service running. You can connect to it with Netcat (nc) as shown at the bottom.

\#\# Objectives  
\- Find a way to extract passwords from the vault so you can download the ZIP  
\- Once you obtain the ZIP, find a way to break the encryption scheme and find the flag file within

Host and port: \`nc 0.cloud.chals.io 18529\`

\#\# Approach and Solution

### **Part 1: Downloading the ZIP File**

The first step is finding the email, which is conveniently located right in the webmail inbox.

Clicking the [link](https://target-flask.chals.io/vault/backup.zip) allows us to attempt downloading the `backup.zip` file. Unfortunately, it requires a username and password. We already have the username from the email—`admin`—but figuring out the password is more challenging.

Running the provided `nc` command logs us into a server with only a few commands available. Running basic commands gives us this output:

Not very helpful. However, we can check the documentation provided for some guidance\! The documentation contains a lot of information, but the key detail is that we can set the MOTD (message of the day) using a variable called `{now}`.

Experimenting on the server shows that we can access properties of the `now` object, but nothing beyond that (I tested extensively). For example, running `MOTD {now.__dict__}` reveals that we can access dunder (magic) methods via the `{now}` object. This is significant because it opens up access to a lot of additional information, including details on how the `{now}` object interacts with the rest of the environment. Specifically, running `MOTD {now.__class__.__dict__}` confirms the presence of an `__init__` function, which allows us to explore even more.

I spent a lot of time experimenting with different commands, mostly to understand Python sandboxing better. While this exploration wasn’t strictly necessary for the challenge, it’s a good practice to thoroughly investigate the environment if time allows—you can learn a lot\!

The crucial part is that by accessing the `init` function, we also gain access to the `globals`. Running:

`MOTD {now.__init__.__globals__}`

reveals...

...the master password: `Li0n_a83*kFYz95!2`

Awesome\! Now we can use this master password to retrieve all the other stored passwords:

* test: `hunter2`  
* backup\_admin: `8szS)89Y$jDq0t}BS:Hj<37J`  
* slots\_admin: `/D~Yl9I*966aI:F0A]4NL7/L`

With these credentials, we return to the site and successfully download the zip file.

But the challenge isn’t over yet...

### **Part 2: Decrypting the ZIP File**

The downloaded zip file is encrypted, so we need to decrypt it to access the flag.

As with any decryption challenge, understanding the encryption method is crucial.

Running a 7zip analysis on the zip file with `7z l -slt backup.zip` returns a lot of information, but here’s the relevant part:

makefile  
Copy code  
`Path = flag.txt`  
`Folder = -`  
`Size = 40`  
`Packed Size = 52`  
`Modified = 2024-07-10 13:02:44`  
`Created =`   
`Accessed =`   
`Attributes =  -rw-r--r--`  
`Encrypted = +`  
`Comment =`   
`CRC = 6E9BC533`  
`Method = ZipCrypto Store`  
`Characteristics = UT:MA:1 ux : Encrypt Descriptor`  
`Host OS = Unix`  
`Version = 10`  
`Volume Index = 0`  
`Offset = 127`

`Path = slots.txt`  
`Folder = -`  
`Size = 1228`  
`Packed Size = 1240`  
`Modified = 2024-07-10 11:38:03`  
`Created =`   
`Accessed =`   
`Attributes =  -rw-r--r--`  
`Encrypted = +`  
`Comment =`   
`CRC = 701575D6`  
`Method = ZipCrypto Store`  
`Characteristics = UT:MA:1 ux : Encrypt Descriptor`  
`Host OS = Unix`  
`Version = 10`  
`Volume Index = 0`  
`Offset = 389`

We can see that the encryption method is ZipCrypto Store. A quick search reveals that this method, also known as PKWARE, is vulnerable to a plaintext attack. That’s exactly what we need.

There’s a tool specifically for this attack on ZipCrypto-encrypted files: [`bkcrack`](https://github.com/kimci86/bkcrack). I built it from source, but you can also use the binaries.

This attack works by exploiting the encryption’s use of a pseudo-random stream of bytes XORed with plaintext to generate ciphertext. If you have a portion of the plaintext, the tool can recover the rest.

Now we need to find some plaintext. The tool requires at least 12 bytes of known plaintext, with 8 bytes being sequential. The zip file contains two files: `slots.txt` and `flag.txt`. Guessing the contents of `flag.txt` would be difficult, so I focused on `slots.txt`.

A few notes about finding plaintext:

1. For different file formats like PNGs or PDFs, you can use magic headers.  
2. Filetypes like XML often have predictable declarations like `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>`.  
3. You can sometimes use the CRC to force an extra byte or two.

Unfortunately, these techniques don’t help here because the files are plain text, which lacks predictable filler. I had to take a different approach.

I remembered that the server had a `slots_admin` password, and there’s a `slots.txt` file in the zip. Could the file be available elsewhere?

I noticed that the URL for the zip file, `https://target-flask.chals.io/vault/backup.zip`, contains a `vault` folder that seems to serve files. What if I change the URL to `https://target-flask.chals.io/vault/slots.txt`?

This works\! I can download the `slots.txt` file, and using the `slots_admin` password from the server, I unlock it and obtain the plaintext.

Now, I run the command:

`./bkcrack -C ~/grasshopper/workbench/backup.zip -c slots.txt -p ~/grasshopper/workbench/slots.txt -D ~/grasshopper/workbench/decrypted.zip`

This decrypts `backup.zip` into `decrypted.zip` in my working directory. Opening it reveals the flag inside `flag.txt`:

`flag{xamine_your_zip_pretty_darn_quick}`
