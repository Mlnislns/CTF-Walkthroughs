\# D8: YARA Analysis

\#\# Problem Description  
You and the rest of The Lucky Lion's IR team are deep in your investigation, digging into hosts with signs of unusual activity. While pulling artifacts from host A (WDIGCVY2S), you identified the tool download utilized by the threat actor. You capture the file and submit it to Strelka, a real-time, container-based file scanning system used for threat hunting, threat detection, and incident response. The \[strelka.json\](resources/strelka.json) results identified the file as AnyDesk and you determined the file was downloaded and utilized by the threat actor.

\#\# Objectives  
Create a YARA rule that will detect the target file. The target file has similar meta information identified in strelka.json. There are a total of 100 files, only one is the target file.

\#\# Approach and Solution

This was by far the toughest defensive challenge in this CTF, primarily due to the complex file format, data organization, and the specialized knowledge required to sift through the files effectively.

We were given the following command to search for the target file:

`curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" https://target-flask.chals.io/api/v1/yara-scan -X POST -d 'rule test {condition: true}'`

This command is a POST request sent with curl to the challenge's domain. The `rule` section of the command is where we can customize and input our YARA rule.

Running the provided command without any modifications gives us this output:

From the output, we can see that the server returns two key-value pairs:

* Whether the target file is included in the returned set  
* The total number of matches for our YARA rule

We also know from the challenge description that the target file has meta information similar (but not identical) to the file analyzed in `strelka.json`.

Now comes the challenging part: sifting through the `strelka.json` file to identify useful information for our search.

My initial attempt focused on the file hashes—if I could match the hashes directly, the solution would be simple\! Unfortunately, since the target file isn't identical, the hashes differ, making them useless for this problem.

I then tried string matching, but due to the unformatted terminal output, it was difficult to get consistent results. I also checked the file header (which yielded 100/100 matches) and the footer (around 30/100 matches). While the footer initially seemed promising, it didn’t provide any additional useful information, so I explored other approaches.

I spent around 4-5 hours chasing down dead ends before thoroughly examining the `strelka.json` file for any clues.

The key to solving this problem lies in the "pe" section of `strelka.json`, specifically the information in the PE header. The PE header contains meta details about the file—exactly what we need.

Here’s the tricky part: the file we’re looking for is only similar, not identical, to the `strelka.json` file. Searching for exact meta values won’t yield results. However, searching for files with values *close* to those in `strelka.json` does.

For example, the file size in `strelka.json` is 5328201\. Searching the server with curl for this exact size gives us:

No matches.

But when we expand the search range to 5328201 \+/- 200, we get:

Much better\! Now we have 3/100 matches, and the target file is included.

Using a quick manual binary search, I pinpoint the exact file size: 5328200\. Searching for this specific value still gives 3/100 results, so additional filters are needed to isolate the target file.

I then applied the same strategy to identify the checksum, PE overlay size, and PE entry point for the target file. The final command looks like this:

`curl -H "Content-Type: text/plain" https://target-flask.chals.io/api/v1/yara-scan -X POST -d 'import "pe" rule Detect_AnyDesk { condition: filesize == 5328200 and pe.overlay.size == 20808 and pe.entry_point == 4325 and pe.checksum == 5359632}'`

Sending this to the server returns:

...which reveals the flag:

`{"flag":"y3t_an0th3r_r3curs1v3_acr0nym"}`
