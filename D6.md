\# D6: PCAP Analysis

\#\# Problem Description  
You have been given a \[PCAP file\](resources/anydesk\_hostonly.pcapng) of Bob's browsing traffic concerning a known Remote Access tool. You'll need to examine the PCAP to determine which tool was downloaded on the host and where it came from.

General Questions:

\- Did the user have any suspicious downloads?  
\- What is the purpose of the executable?  
\- What was the domain the executable was downloaded from?  
\- What is the source port?

\#\# Objectives  
Determine if there was a suspicious download, what it was, and where it came from. Identify the full request URI that the executable was downloaded from.

\#\# Approach and Solution  
This is a fairly simple Wireshark problem. I’m writing this mainly to help those who might not be familiar with the tool.

When we first open the given PCAP file with Wireshark, we see this:

We are particularly focused on anything highlighted in green. In Wireshark, green indicates that the packet is part of a successful TCP session—in other words, these are the packets likely to contain details about any downloads.

As we scroll through the PCAP file and glance over the green highlights, we notice something interesting:

This is the packet we’ve been searching for\! It’s clearly identified as an application, which matches our criteria.

By selecting the packet and expanding the Hypertext Transfer Protocol, we can see the following:

This gives us the full request URI for the executable.
