\# O9: Escalate Your Privileges

\#\# Problem Description  
Things are going well \- you've gained initial access to another host on The Lucky Lion's network, but you have limited access with your current privileges. Let's open up a terminal and see if you can change that.

One of the easiest ways to run a command that you don't have permission to execute is to find a file that DOES have the right permissions and have it execute your command for you, all you have to do is find the right file\!

\#\# Objective  
Using the NARSH (Not A Real Shell) emulator, find a file with world writable permissions that executes as root.

Web Shell: https://target-httpd.chals.io/shell/privesc.html

\#\# Approach and Solution

We’re back in that restricted environment again. Fortunately, it’s much more straightforward this time—it’s mainly a matter of exploration.

Given our previous experience, we can assume our permissions are still very limited (basically, nothing). This means commands like `chmod` or anything needing elevated privileges are off the table.

For this challenge, exploration is key. Luckily, we have access to `ls -l`. Running it gives us this output:

Looks like we’ve got a lot of directories to sift through...

Starting from the root directory, I methodically run `ls -l` on each directory one by one. A folder named “scripts” looks promising, so let’s check it out:

There are a lot of scripts here\! However, none of them have global rwx permissions, so even if one of these was the correct file, we wouldn’t be able to access it. This turns out to be a red herring.

With that out of the way, it’s time for the slow process of searching through every directory. The general approach is:

* If it’s a directory, run `ls -l` and explore further if anything is inside.  
* If it’s a `.sh` file, check its permissions. If it doesn’t have global rwx, move on.  
* If it’s a file but not a `.sh` file, use `cat` to read its contents.

Following this method, I eventually find a deep directory: `/var/spool/cron/crontabs`, which contains two files: `narsh` and `root`. This is promising because we know our user is “narsh,” and the other file likely belongs to the root user.

Using `cat root` reveals this content:

bash  
Copy code  
`# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.`  
`#`   
`# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line`  
`# indicating with different fields when the task will be run`  
`# and what command to run for the task`  
`#`   
`# To define the time you can provide concrete values for`  
`# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),`  
`# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').`  
`#`   
`# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system`  
`# daemon's notion of time and timezones.`  
`#`   
`# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through`  
`# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).`  
`#`   
`# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts`  
`# at 5 a.m every week with:`  
`# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/`  
`#`   
`# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)`  
`#`   
`# m h  dom mon dow   command`  
`2 0 * * * root /scripts/yydUpQ.sh`

The file clearly points us to `yydUpQ.sh` as the target with the correct permissions.

Submitting the filename as our flag, and bingo\! It’s correct\!
