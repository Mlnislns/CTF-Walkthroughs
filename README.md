This folder contains writeups for many of the more challenging problems featured in the 2024 Target CTF.

The problems were presented in a sequence that told a story as you progressed through them.

There were two categories of challenges: Offensive (O) and Defensive (D). Each problem is labeled accordingly. For example, O1 represents Offensive 1, the first offensive challenge.

Most of these challenges can be solved using the images and information provided here, except for those requiring active interaction with a web server.
