\# D2: Look for Insider Threats

\#\# Problem Description  
In addition to securing your perimeter, it would probably be a good idea to double-check that you don't have any insiders working against The Lucky Lion, especially knowing Tacky Termite has occasionally used insiders to help them gain access to their victims' environments in the past.

One standard way to look for insider threats is to try to find sensitive data in places it shouldn't be. As a member of the Data Loss Prevention team, you could craft a Regular Expression (RegEx) to find TINs, or Tax Identification Numbers stored in unusual locations in The Lucky Lion's environment. The Lucky Lion is required to store TINs (only Social Security Numbers and Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers) for gamblers who win more than $5000 (the regulations don't say how they have to store them, though\!), though they should never appear anywhere other than the database that's intended to store them.

Normally, this task wouldn't be too hard, and there are lots of examples out there for TINs already. Unfortunately, the decision was made at one point to "encrypt" the TINs in a misguided attempt to increase security. Your job is now much more fun™\!

The "encryption" method, which they've taken to calling Visionàry Algorithm Protecting IDs, involves modifying each digit using its corresponding value in the passphrase: LUCKYLION

def vapid(tin, key="LUCKYLION") -> bytes:
    if isinstance(key, str):
        key = key.encode("ascii")
    if isinstance(tin, bytes):
        tin = tin.decode("ascii")
    key_len = len(key)
    ciphertext = []
    for idx, character in enumerate(tin):
        ciphertext.append(int(character) + key[idx % key_len])
    return bytes(ciphertext)

For example:  
\- 000000000 becomes LUCKYLION  
\- 111111111 becomes MVDLZMJPO

\#\# Objective  
Your mission is to write a RegEx that can find these obfuscated TINs so it can be deployed into various DLP sensors. This will ensure we'll be alerted if someone or something is exfiltrating sensitive customer data.

Fortunately, your coworker wrote a script--\[snort.py-\](resources/snort.py)-that you can use to test your RegEx against a representative dataset. Download the script and run it with \--help to get started:

\`python snort.py \--help\`  
Here's an example run:

\`python snort.py 'regex(\_|\\s+)goes\_?here$'\`  
Note the single quotes ' surrounding the RegEx. These will usually protect it from shell expansion.

Note: Your regex needs to avoid matching unencrypted TINs, e.g. 123456789, as there are already appliances looking for these and we don't want to create duplicate alerts\! To be clear, your regex can ONLY match VAPID-encrypted TINs\!

Additional Note: TINs in this context refers exclusively to SSNs and ITINs. EINs/FEINs are for employers (companies), who can't gamble. PTINs are for tax preparers and also can't be associated with gambling winnings. ATINs are for children, who sadly can't legally gamble (yet).

\#\# Approach and Solution

We already know that we need to write a regex pattern, but what about the rest of the challenge? Let's first review the information we have. We know TINs are always 9-digit numbers, and when transformed, they convert into some ASCII text.

Next, we need to identify the encryption method used on these TINs. The problem statement tells us that 000000000 becomes LUCKYLION, and the vapid function reveals that the key is encoded and decoded as ASCII. This suggests the encryption works by adding the ASCII values of LUCKYLION to the TIN, then decoding the result back into ASCII.

From this, we can infer that each digit of the 9-digit TIN falls within a specific range. Each digit is between 0 and 9, but these digits are shifted according to the ASCII value of the corresponding character in LUCKYLION. For instance, the ASCII value of 'L' is 76, so the first digit's possible ASCII range is 76 to 85\. The ASCII value of 'U' is 85, so the range for the second digit is 85 to 94, and so on.

For the regex, we convert these ranges into hexadecimal. We format them as byte values (e.g., `\x00`) to be used in the regex pattern. Then we construct our regex with the appropriate formatting.

The final regex pattern is:

`(?:[\x4C-\x55])(?:[\x55-\x5E])(?:[\x43-\x4C])(?:[\x4B-\x54])(?:[\x59-\x62])(?:[\x4C-\x55])(?:[\x49-\x52])(?:[\x4F-\x58])(?:[\x4E-\x57])`

When run with `snort.py`, it returns the message: `found unauthorized user handling TINs: RegexRanger`

And `RegexRanger` is the flag\!
