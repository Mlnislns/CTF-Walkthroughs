\# O3: Constructing Your Phish

\#\# Problem Description  
You have your credential harvester ready to go, but how exactly are you going to trick your victims into visiting the site hosting it? Much like the harvester, your "hook" will work best if it mimicks something legitimate that the victim is expecting to see.

While researching The Lucky Lion leading in preparation for this attack, you had discovered that the casino uses multi-factor authentication for employees. Specifically, you learned that they use Squishy Security, a budget security solution notorious for a host of backdoors. Employees need to scan a QR code to sign up with the service on their company phones, so perhaps we can phish them to click on our harvester? Given \[this MFA onboarding email\](img/o3-1.png), can you engineer an attack QR code to capitalize on Squishy Security's lackluster control mechanisms?

\#\# Objectives  
\- Crack the MFA QR code's security scheme  
\- Submit your own malicious QR code that is the same as the example, except it would redirect to http://wood-chewers.trees instead of the normal casino sign-in. NOTE: if the example QR's text had any special formatting/encryption applied, so should your submitted QR\!

\#\# Approach and Solution

The first thing that stands out in the example onboarding email is the QR code. Scanning it gives us this string:

`XVFQZkFVUUBVQwsZc312c3N0eH5zBHBzfXZwaXNxd2NndHB7c3EPDw0KDAQ4QldWWUVUWkZvR0BcDRFRRkRCCB8YVEFTXUJeVRlSVl8=`

...which appears to be random gibberish. However, it's quickly recognizable as Base64. Decoding it from Base64 gives us:

`]QPfAUQ@UC s}vsstx~sps}vpisqwcgtp{sq8BWVYETZFoG@\QFDBTAS]B^URV_`

...which is still unintelligible, indicating another layer of encryption.

We get a clue from the email, though. It mentions that Squishy Security has partnered with "Xpert Online Resilience"—hinting at XOR encryption.

Here are two key points about XOR encryption that make solving this possible:

1. XORing something that is already XORed will revert it to its original form. In other words, XORing the ciphertext with the key reveals the plaintext. But XORing the ciphertext with known plaintext also reveals the key.  
2. XOR encryption uses a repeating key pattern, meaning if the message is longer than the key, the key repeats until it covers the entire message.

This means if we XOR the encrypted data with known plaintext, we can extract the key\!

Luckily, the email provides us with some plaintext: the `mfa_secret` field within the QR code. By XORing the Base64-decoded ciphertext with `mfa_secret:` , we get:

The numbers at the beginning represent the key due to the properties of XOR. We now use those numbers as the key, which gives us:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce84602a-f54d-4dd4-9178-cd43d4e380cc)


This shows we’re on the right track\! We see the `mfa_secret` field along with parts of readable words like "redirect url" and a URL ending in ".com". Now we need to fine-tune the key.

The numbers from our XOR operation are 071920220719\. Noticing the repetition, we suspect the actual key is 07192022\. Trimming off the last four digits, we test this hypothesis, and decrypting the ciphertext with this key gives us:

Success\! We’ve cracked the QR code\!

To insert our malicious URL, we replace `http://example.com` with `http://wood-chewers.trees`, re-encrypt the data (by XORing it with the key, then re-encoding it in Base64), and get this ciphertext (including the `=` at the end for accurate formatting):

`XVFQZkFVUUBVQwsZc312c3N0eH5zBHBzfXZwaXNxd2NndHB7c3EPDw0KDAQ4QldWWUVUWkZvR0BcDRFRRkRCCB8YRlZdVB9RWFJGXEBDHEZCUlRK=`

Finally, we generate a QR code with this ciphertext and submit it.

When we do, we receive the flag:

`flag{WI$h_I'd_Squ!sh3d_Th@t_BuG}`
